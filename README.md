It was only a decade or two ago that people thought joggers were eccentric health nuts. I believe meditation holds the same stigma. Thus, I truly believe that meditation will be the "next jogging" in that it will become one of the basic requirements for a healthy life. 

That being said, I searched the internet for a record of suicides and found one produced by Conneticut. I imported it into Python and wrote code to sort ethnicity and suicide rate. 

I found that the "other" ethnicity group, which includes all races except whites, blacks and hispanics were at most risk. Furthermore, this group was at most risk during age 20 to 24 and 35 to 39.
