# 2.Basic-Data-Trawling
We were tasked to mine data for information and trends

STATED GOAL FOR PROJECT
We want to find out which groups at what ages are at most risk for which unnatural causes (e.g murder) of death. Subsequently, we want to find out at what ages these groups then become at risk for natural causes of death e.g Cancer/Heart Failure. 


CONCLUSION
From a logical standpoint, if it is found that murder is the leading cause of unnatural death for an ethnicity during a certain age, then great care must be taken in concluding the cause for the murder.
